Is New York City unique in the extent that a few operators dominate listings revenue? *Yes* and *No*.
I ran the same calculations on other cities and there is definitely variation in the degree to which revenue
is clustered among a small percentage of listings. New York is on the more extremely clustered side of the spectrum.

Some cities do seem to have a less concentrated AirBnB market than others, although none are anywhere close to egalitarian. I'm not sure what to make of it yet, but I wonder whether implementing short term rental regulations or other policies could bend these market-share curves towards being more equitable. Some cities that have done so (Austin, Berlin) do seem to be less concentrated than New York, San Francisco, or NOLA. At this point it's just an idea, there's a lot more work to be done.
