                  <h1><a href="/2017/KCities/"> A Tale of K Cities</a> </h1>
                <!--     <h3> - 08 April 2017 </h3> -->
                  <p> <p>Here’s a little project I did running clustering algorithms on New York City neighborhoods. Anybody who lives in the five boroughs knows certain neighborhoods are more like others, whether for cultural, economic, or other reasons. I fed a bunch of sociological and economic data from the 2010 Census into a K-means clustering algorithm and asked it to identify three distinct types of neighborhoods in the city. What makes this interesting is I didn’t feed the model any underlying structure (this is unsupervised learning). Nevertheless, the results match a lot of my qualitative priors established from living in NYC for the past eight years. So what do I think the clustering algorithm found?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cluster 1</strong>: Manhattan south of 110th Street and Downtown Brooklyn, AKA “ The Tourist Guide to NYC” or “Starbucks and Duane Reade on every corner.”</li>
  <li><strong>Cluster 2</strong>: Low-to-middle income neighborhoods in the boroughs (and Lower East Side in Manhattan), usually with high minority and foreign-born populations. Also the center of ongoing gentrification.</li>
  <li><strong>Cluster 3</strong>:  Staten Island + other working-middle class neighborhoods in the far boroughs. This is where you may find people saying “fugheddaboudit” out loud.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s the conclusion here? I was struck by how a simple algorithm with relatively little data was able to find underlying structure. Of course, that structure was meaningless without outside human interpretation - which is in turn subjective and fallible. So by all means, let your machines learn. But do remember to interpret what they tell you!</p>

                  <h1><a href="/2016/OtherAirBnBCities/"> AirBnB Addendum: What about other cities?</a> </h1>
                <!--     <h3> - 19 September 2016 </h3> -->
                  <p> <p>Is New York City unique in the extent that a few operators dominate listings revenue? <em>Yes</em> and <em>No</em>.
I ran the same calculations on other cities and there is definitely variation in the degree to which revenue
is clustered among a small percentage of listings. New York is on the more extremely clustered side of the spectrum.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="600" align="middle" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~s_rimmele/67.embed"></iframe>

<p>Some cities do seem to have a less concentrated AirBnB market than others, although none are anywhere close to egalitarian. I’m not sure what to make of it yet, but I wonder whether implementing short term rental regulations or other policies could bend these market-share curves towards being more equitable. Some cities that have done so (Austin, Berlin) do seem to be less concentrated than New York, San Francisco, or NOLA. At this point it’s just an idea, there’s a lot more work to be done.</p>

                  <h1><a href="/2016/AirBNB/"> What do I think about AirBnB?</a> </h1>
                <!--     <h3> - 21 August 2016 </h3> -->
                  <p> <p>A new <a href="https://www.airbnbaction.com/how-airbnb-can-support-low-income-neighborhoods-in-nyc/">AiRBnB study</a> came out recently and I felt compelled to respond. Dumping the entirety of my thoughts on AirBnB’s role in the city - and NYC in particular - is overwhelming and will take more free time than I have. Instead I’d like to focus on one facet of AirBnB’s PR strategy that I’ve seen over and over, including in the aforementioned study.</p>

<p>AirBnB’s claim to being a socially responsible company seems to be that they empower ordinary people to make a little extra money by renting some or part of their full-time housing on the short-term market. Let’s just put aside the conversation about whether this kind of thing should be allowable or not and take AirBnB up on this premise for a moment.</p>

<p>Even if this is true, it’s not reflective of the platform AirBnB runs. Using data from <a href="http://www.insideairbnb.com">insideairbnb</a> , I used a simple model to estimate how much revenue each active listing on the site pulls in annually. This allowed me to make what I’ve seen referred to as a ‘whale chart’: a kind of cumulative distribution that plots the percentage of a total variable of interest e.g., AirBnB revenue that is captured by a percentage of unique listings. They serve as a way to visualize market structure; a whale chart that is very steep near the left side of the picture shows a market dominated by a few large actors (think sperm whale). A more egalitarian market structure would have a more gentle hump (maybe a humpback whale?).</p>

<p>A whale chart is compelling because it becomes easy to see that relatively few listings pull in most of the revenue. Just look at Bed-Stuy. The AirBnB market in this neighborhood is dominated by 20% of listings that seem to pull in over 65% of the revenue. Conversely, 25% of active listings in 2015 didn’t seem to earn any money!</p>

<p>AirBnB is not in the business of helping ordinary people earn a little extra money by renting out their apartments occasionally. AirBnB is in the business of building a platform for (a small number of) commercial operators that drive a huge proportion of total listings and revenue for the company. Helping the little guy earn extra money on the side is not what earned AirBnB a $30 billion dollar valuation; it is incidental at best. It strikes me as intellectually dishonest for AirBnB to keep pushing the little guy narrative. I challenge AirBnB to make a serious effort at eliminating commercial listings on the site (it’s not that hard) and become the company it claims so vocally to be.</p>

<p><strong>Data Footnote</strong>: <em>My revenue data is modeled because AirBnB doesn’t release this type of data. As such, it is vulnerable to bias and error. I also challenge AirBnB to prove me wrong and release data showing listing revenue (and by extension AirBnB’s own revenue) is not driven by a small subset of likely commercial actors.</em></p>
